# Task
Extract key points from reasoning trajectories and evaluate existing playbook key points.

# Reasoning Trajectories
{trajectories}

# Current Playbook
{playbook}

# Instructions
1. Key points should have reference value for future sessions, such as:
   - Failed approaches to avoid
   - Successful solutions and patterns
   - User preferences and habits

2. Extract NEW key points from trajectories that are NOT already in the Current Playbook

3. Evaluate EACH existing playbook key point by its name:
   - "helpful": key point was useful/applied correctly
   - "harmful": key point caused issues/wrong guidance
   - "neutral": key point not relevant to this session

# Output Format
{{
  "new_key_points": [
    "First key point extracted from the session",
    "Second key point extracted from the session"
  ],
  "evaluations": [
    {{"name": "kpt_001", "rating": "helpful"}},
    {{"name": "kpt_002", "rating": "neutral"}}
  ]
}}
